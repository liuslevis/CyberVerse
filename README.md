### One Photo. A Living Digital Human.

> Ever dreamed of having your own J.A.R.V.I.S. — an AI that truly sees you, hears you, and talks back in real time?

> Want to see someone you've lost again, hear their voice, watch them smile at you?

> Or maybe there's a character you've always wished you could bring to life?

>
 **Just one photo. CyberVerse makes them alive.**

CyberVerse is an open-source **digital human agent platform** with real-time video calling. Create an AI agent you can see and talk to, face to face, just like a video call.

## Features

### Real-Time Video Call

Not pre-recorded. Not turn-based. A live, low-latency video call with a digital human — first frame in **~1.5s**. Built on WebRTC with P2P streaming and embedded TURN/NAT traversal.

### Agent, Not Just an Avatar

Every digital human is more than an avatar you can talk to. It is the AI that actually does things.

### One Photo to Life

Upload a single photo to create your digital human. State-of-the-art avatar models deliver real-time facial animation, natural lip-sync, and subtle idle breathing — no 3D modeling or motion capture.

### Assemble Your Agent

Brain, face, voice, ears — every component is a swappable plugin. Mix and match LLMs, TTS engines, ASR models, and avatar backends via YAML config.

## Hardware Requirements

Real-time video conversation requires GPU acceleration. Below are benchmarks for FlashHead and LiveAct avatar models:

| Model | Quality | GPU | Count | Resolution | FPS | Real-time? |
|-------|---------|-----|-------|------------|-----|------------|
| FlashHead 1.3B | Pro | RTX 5090 | 2 | 512×512 | 25+ | ✅ Yes |
| FlashHead 1.3B | Pro | RTX 4090 | 1 | 512×512 | ~10.8 | ❌ No |
| FlashHead 1.3B | Lite | RTX 4090 | 1 | 512×512 | 96 | ✅ Yes |
| LiveAct 18B | — | RTX PRO 6000 | 2 | 320×480 | 20 | ✅ Yes |

> **Pro** delivers higher visual quality; **Lite** is optimized for speed. GPUs with compute power comparable to 2× RTX 5090 (e.g., A100 80GB, H100) can run the Pro model in real-time. Lite runs real-time on a single RTX 4090.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node 18+
- Go 1.22+
- PyTorch 2.8 (CUDA 12.8)
- GPU with CUDA 12.8+
- FFmpeg (must include `libvpx` for video encoding)

### Step 1: Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/CyberVerse.git
cd CyberVerse
```

### Step 2: Create Python environment

```bash
conda create -n cyberverse python=3.10
conda activate cyberverse
```

### Step 3: Configure environment variables

```bash
cp infra/.env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`, fill in your API keys:

```
DOUBAO_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_doubao_access_token   # ByteDance Doubao voice LLM
DOUBAO_APP_ID=your_doubao_app_id
```

After the stack is running, you can change these values (and other API keys / service endpoints) from the web UI at **`/settings`** instead of editing `.env` only.

### Step 4: Download model weights

CyberVerse can use **FlashHead** or **LiveAct** as the avatar backend (see `inference.avatar.default` in `cyberverse_config.yaml`). **You do not need every asset below** — download only the stack you will run (FlashHead uses `facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h`; LiveAct uses `chinese-wav2vec2-base`).

```bash
pip install "huggingface_hub[cli]"
```

#### FlashHead (SoulX-FlashHead)

| Model Component | Description | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SoulX-FlashHead-1_3B` | 1.3B FlashHead weights | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Soul-AILab/SoulX-FlashHead-1_3B) |
| `wav2vec2-base-960h` | Audio feature extractor | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h) |

```bash
# If you are in mainland China, you can use a mirror first:
# export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com

huggingface-cli download Soul-AILab/SoulX-FlashHead-1_3B \
  --local-dir ./checkpoints/SoulX-FlashHead-1_3B

huggingface-cli download facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h \
  --local-dir ./checkpoints/wav2vec2-base-960h
```

#### LiveAct (SoulX-LiveAct)

| ModelName | Download |
|-----------|----------|
| SoulX-LiveAct | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Soul-AILab/LiveAct), [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/Soul-AILab/LiveAct) |
| chinese-wav2vec2-base | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/TencentGameMate/chinese-wav2vec2-base) |

```bash
huggingface-cli download Soul-AILab/LiveAct \
  --local-dir ./checkpoints/LiveAct

huggingface-cli download TencentGameMate/chinese-wav2vec2-base \
  --local-dir ./checkpoints/chinese-wav2vec2-base
```


### Step 5: Update config

Edit `cyberverse_config.yaml`, update the model paths to match your local checkpoints:

```yaml
inference:
  avatar:
    flash_head:
      checkpoint_dir: "./checkpoints/SoulX-FlashHead-1_3B"  # ← your path
      wav2vec_dir: "./checkpoints/wav2vec2-base-960h"        # ← your path
      cuda_visible_devices: 0      # your GPU ID(s), e.g. 0,1 for multi-GPU
      world_size: 1                # GPU count, set to 2 for dual-GPU
      model_type: "lite"           # "pro" for higher quality (needs more GPU)
```

You can skip editing paths here for now and adjust these options later in the web UI.

### Step 6: Install SageAttention & FlashAttention (optional)
```bash
# SageAttention 
pip install sageattention==2.2.0 --no-build-isolation
```

```bash
# FlashAttention (optional)
pip install ninja
pip install flash_attn==2.8.0.post2 --no-build-isolation
```

> If compilation is slow, download a prebuilt wheel from [flash-attention releases](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/tag/v2.8.0.post2) and `pip install <wheel>.whl`.



### Step 7: Install project dependencies

```bash
make setup
```

This installs the base editable package (`[dev,inference]`), generates gRPC stubs, and installs frontend dependencies. For extra Python packages, either install **everything** (large) or **cherry-pick** extras listed under `[project.optional-dependencies]` in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml):

```bash
# all optional groups at once
pip install -e ".[all]"

# or pick what you need, e.g.:
pip install -e ".[voice_llm,flash_head]"
pip install -e ".[live_act]"
```

### Step 8: Start services (3 terminals)

**Terminal 1** — Python inference server:

```bash
conda activate cyberverse
make inference
```

`make inference` will read `inference.avatar.default` from `cyberverse_config.yaml`, then initialize exactly that one avatar model in the current inference process. Startup logs will print the active avatar model.

Wait until you see:

- `Active avatar model initialized: <model_name>`
- `CyberVerse Inference Server started on port 50051`

**Terminal 2** — Go API server:

```bash
make server
```

**Terminal 3** — Frontend:

```bash
make frontend
```

### Step 9: Verify

```bash
# Check API health
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser — you're ready to go.

## Roadmap

### **Digital Human Creation Platform**  
Configure characters, inference, and launch real-time digital-human sessions.

- [x] Character CRUD with multiple reference images, active image and fixed/random display mode, optional face crop, tags, voice fields, personality, welcome message, and system prompt
- [x] Real-time avatar video driven from reference images via configurable avatar plugins (e.g. FlashHead, LiveAct)
- [x] Real-time voice and video over WebRTC — **direct** P2P (embedded TURN) or **LiveKit** SFU (`pipeline.streaming_mode`); sessions support **voice_llm** and **standard** (text→LLM→TTS→avatar) pipelines
- [x] YAML-pluggable inference stack (avatar, voice LLM, LLM, TTS, ASR); launch UI for avatar parameters; switching the configured default avatar model typically requires restarting the inference service
- [x] Web **Settings** (`/settings`) for API keys and service endpoints, with connection testing and persistence to config
- [x] Per-character conversation history persisted on disk and exposed via the REST API
- [x] Optional session video recording (`recording` in `cyberverse_config.yaml`)
- [ ] Knowledge and document import for character-grounded answers (RAG)

### 2. **Actionable Digital Humans**  
Turn digital humans into agents with memory, tools, and task execution.
- [ ] Add long-term memory across sessions
- [ ] Add tool use and function calling
- [ ] Add workflow execution and task completion

### 3. **Agent Network**  
Connect multiple agents so they can communicate, collaborate, and form networks.
- [ ] Enable agent-to-agent communication
- [ ] Enable multi-agent collaboration and delegation
- [ ] Enable shared memory and shared knowledge between agents
- [ ] Build an open network of connected agents
